# IssWatcher

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.1.

## About

I.S.S. watcher serves four purposes: The default pages shows the user's sunrise and sunset times. An iss live tracker, an iss next-passes generator, and a list of the people currently on the iss. It uses the [Open notify](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/) api, and the [Sunrise Sunset](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api) api.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

`ng test` Has two tests. A tautological true=true as a placeholder for future tests, and a functional test.
`ng e2e` tests the page title.
